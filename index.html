  <p><b>What is so Unique about this company?</b>

Role based Learnings: We design learning framework and tailor curriculum after assessing the students current skills and has helped many students in the past with even no computer background to work for big companies like Expedia and Microsoft. Our Curriculums are well rounded and blended with right elements of business, process, technical and soft skills. In other words, we do not teach SQL or C# but rather we map technologies to professional role like Analyst, Developer, Tester etc. and have our courses deliver right set of course content, hands on workshops, practical home assignments and real case studies based on role.  We believe in quality and not quantity and hence our learning circles contains batch of 5-8 students that gives opportunity to get adequate attention and support from our instructors.<br/>

Tailored Speed: Training Modules are spaced out in across multiple months to adjust to the absorption rate of the students. Although Learning Phase may have 50 hours of effort involved but it may be spaced to 3 months to ensure there is enough self-learning opportunity provided to the students and time to complete home assignments. On average person starting fresh in Software Industry may need 6 to 9 months of rigorous coaching before getting ready for professional interviews.<br/>

Drive for Results: Although we empower and enable our students to achieve certifications but that is not what we aim for. We aim for getting highly paid jobs and provide placement services for the candidates going through our program
Not only we coach students how to get a job but also provide framework how to maintain a job.</p>
