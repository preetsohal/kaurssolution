  <h2 id="unique"> <u>How we are different</u></h2>
  <p><b>What is so Unique about this company?</b><br/>
  <b><u>Role based Learning:</u></b> We design learning framework and tailor curriculm after assessing the students current skills and has helped many students in the past with even no computer background to work for big companies like <b>Expedia</b>and <b>Microsoft</b>. Our Curriculm are well rounded and blended with right elementsof business, process, technical and soft skills. In other words, we do not teach <b>SQL</b>, or <b>C#</b> but rather we map technologies to professional role like <b>Analyst,Developer, Tester</b> etc, and have our courses deliver right set of course content, hands on workshop, practical home assignments and real world case studies based on role. We believe in quality anot in quantity and hence our learning circles contain batch of 5-8 students that gives oppertunity to get adequete attention and support from our instructors.<br/>

  <b>Tailored Speed:</b> Training Modeles are spaced out in across multiple months to adjust to the absorption rate of the students. Although Learning phase may have 50 hours of effort involved but it may be spaced to 3 months to ensure there is enough self-learning oppertunity provided to the students and time to complete home assignments. On average person starting fresh in Software Industry may need 6 to 9 months rigorous coching before getting ready for professional interviews. <br/>

  <b>Drive for Result :</b>Although we empower and enable our students to achieve certifications but that is not what we aim for. we aim for getting highly paid jobs and provide placement services for the candidates going through our program.<br/>
  Not only we coach students how to get a job but also provide framework how to maintain a job.
